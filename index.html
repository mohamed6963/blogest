I have something a bit different for you today.
<br>
As I said here, I want to be more personal and
<br>
let you take a glimpse into my daily life more often.
<br>
As a quite nosy gal, I love getting to know the person
<br>
behind a blog and their routines so I thought it would
<br>
be interesting to share with you a typical day in my life.
<br>
Let me warn you, it is a normal workday,
<br>
nothing fancy or very entertaining. But I thought
<br>
it could still be fun to share it nonetheless.
<br>
Hope you find it interesting!
<br>
Here is what I get up to on a normal weekday.
