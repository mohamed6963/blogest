I have something a bit different for you today.
<br>
As I said here, I want to be more personal and
<br>
let you take a glimpse into my daily life more often.
<br>
As a quite nosy gal, I love getting to know the person
<br>
behind a blog and their routines so I thought it would
<br>
be interesting to share with you a typical day in my life.
<br>
Let me warn you, it is a normal workday,
<br>
nothing fancy or very entertaining. But I thought
<br>
it could still be fun to share it nonetheless.
<br>
Hope you find it interesting!
<br>
Here is what I get up to on a normal weekday.

    <h2>HOW TO STAYING SAFE ONLINE...</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="/3-.jpg" alt="please check your internet">
    <br>
    Don’t keep your fears to yourself. If you are worried
    <br>
    about your safety or something that has happened to you
    <br>
    online, urgently speak to an adult you trust. Visit Child
    <br>
    Helpline International to find out the names and details of
    <br>
    organizations in your country who can help you. Many countries
    <br>
    have a special helpline you can call for free and talk to someone anonymously.
    <br>
    Respect what other people are saying on social media,
    <br>
    even if you do not agree with them.
    <br>
    You have the right to privacy - and so do others.
    <br>
    It is not okay to log into other people’s accounts or
    <br>
    to use their phones or profiles without their permission.
    <br>
    Don’t spread rumors or post/share hurtful or embarrassing
    <br>
    stories or photos. What may seem like a harmless joke
    <br>
    to one person can be deeply hurtful to others. We all
    <br>
    have the right to dignity and to be treated with respect.
    <br>
    Think twice before you click ‘send’ - especialle
    <br>
    if you’re upset or angry. Once you share a photo or
    <br>
    a video it’s hard to control what happens to it and who
    <br>
    sees it. Taking it down is nearly impossible.
